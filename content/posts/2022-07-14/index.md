Welcome to my blog — this is my first blog entry. What should I write about — who knows? Probably something about the software that I build in the future — hopefully?

Maybe I will write about other matters too, like cats or cookies. But those subjects are possibly more complicated and require more nuance — so maybe I should avoid them altogether? It is a difficult decision one has to make: choosing between writing about software or cookies.

These are just the ramblings of a tired individual soon heading2 to bed — no need to pay them even a sliver of attention. Just some filler text written to demonstrate the styling of prose for this custom blog theme. Imperfect, inconsequential, and careless — Lorem Ipsum.

Not unlike many other things in life...
